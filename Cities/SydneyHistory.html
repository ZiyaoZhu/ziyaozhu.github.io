               <p><strong>
								 Affectionately named after his eating habits, Pig was rescued from Forrest Beach in North Queensland when he became separated from his mother at a very early age. After a period of rehabilitation, Pig was released into the wild. However when he was found washed up again a decision was made not to release him again for fears he wouldn't survive.

 This big, gentle mammalian herbivore may not at first glance look much like the mermaids you might have read about in myths and legends. It's thought that the legend of dugongs belonging to the Sirenia (the Greek word for mermaid) originated from delirious sailors who mistook the animals for seductive fishy-tailed females after too long out on the ocean. The common name, dugong, comes from a Malay word meaning 'lady of the sea'. In fact, dugongs are most closely related not to any other sea creature, but to elephants.

							<p><strong>
								Despite its fearsome appearance and rows of sharp teeth, the Grey Nurse shark offers no threat to humans and is, in fact, a superbly adapted fish-eater, usually swallowing its prey whole. During the 1960s and 1970s, the population of the Grey Nurse shark declined sharply and in 1984, they became the first shark species in the world to be awarded protected status. SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium supports conservation measures to protect the species, such as through the establishment of marine parks where fishing is prohibited.</strong></p>

								 Meet Plugga, a 120kg rescue Australian Green Sea Turtle. Plugga was found washed up on a beach in 1990 with much of her right-rear flipper missing. After she outgrew her home in a marine park in Coffs Harbour she made the journey down to us here in Sydney. Plugga now lives with us and her 3 other turtle tank mates in our Day and Night on the Reef zone.
