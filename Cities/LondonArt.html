						<p><strong>The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900.

The Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it attracted only 1,197,143 visitors, a drop of 50 percent from 2019, but it still ranked eighth on the list of most-visited art museums in the world.</strong></p>

							 <h3>1. SUNFLOWERS ARE NOT ONE PAINTING, BUT TWO SERIES OF PAINTINGS.</h3>
               <p><strong>
                 The first set of four is known as The Paris Sunflowers. These were created when the artist lived with his brother Theo in the City of Light, ahead of moving to Arles in the south of France in 1888. That August, van Gogh began the Arles Sunflowers while renting four rooms in a yellow house.

							<h3>2. IT'S EASY TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO SETS FROM ONE ANOTHER.</h3>
							<p><strong>
								The Arles Sunflowers are posed in vases, poking skyward; the Paris series presents the flowers lying on the ground.

								The painting in the National Gallery in London is one of the two sketches of the popular summer destinations La Grenouillère on the Seine close to Bougival. The other sketch is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York. The final version which Monet painted later is now lost. Renoir also spent two months at La Grenouillère in 1869 and painted several versions such as the one now in the Collection Oskar Reinhart in Winterthur, Switzerland, and the one now in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.

              <h3> Rembrandt copied the pose from other painters’ self protrait! </h3>

							 <p><strong>
								 Rembrandt’s pose and dress are inspired by several other works, including Raphael’s portrait of Baldassare Castiglione (now in The Louvre), the author of “The Book of the Courtier,’ a manual on good manners for renaissance gentlemen, Williams said. Rembrandt saw the painting at an art auction and was so impressed that he made a drawing of it and noted the high price – 35 guilders – for which it sold. He understood the value of the piece, both on the market and historically, and as an ambitious artist he probably aspired for his work to do as well. The didactic on the wall near Rembrandt’s self-portrait offers more examples of his inspiration, including work by Albrecht Durer.
