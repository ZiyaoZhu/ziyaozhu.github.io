							<p> <Strong> Unfortunately, a fire that broke out on April 15, 2019, destroyed a large portion of the cathedral,
								 including the iconic spire known as "la fléche" ("arrow") and the roof made of 800-year-old lumber known as "The Forest."
								 The 13th-century South Rose Window—which was created and offered to the church by King St.
								 Louis in 1260—the archaeological crypt at Notre Dame, and the 8,000-pipe La Grand Orgue (The Great Organ) survived the flame.</Strong></p>
