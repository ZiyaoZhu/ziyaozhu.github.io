						<p><strong>The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, in Central London. Founded in 1824, it houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900.

The Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry to the main collection is free of charge. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it attracted only 1,197,143 visitors, a drop of 50 percent from 2019, but it still ranked eighth on the list of most-visited art museums in the world.</strong></p>

                The Palmer Cup is about 800 years old and of exceptional quality. It has survived thanks to being prized from the moment it was made. It’s made up of an enamelled glass beaker from Syria or Egypt in the early 1200s mounted on a silver-gilt foot made in France shortly afterwards. In 1893, Mrs Palmer-Morewood took it to the British Museum for identification. Curator A W Franks suggested she put it up for auction, where it was purchased by Baron Ferdinand. Franks had probably tipped off the Baron in the hope that it would end up at the Museum. </Strong></p>

This is one of a pair of guardian figures that flanked one of the entrances into the throne room of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). Stone mythological guardians, sculpted in the relief or in the round, were often placed at gateways to ancient Mesopotamia palaces, to protect them from demonic forces.

              <h3> Rembrandt copied the pose from other painters’ self protrait! </h3>

							 <p><strong>
								 Rembrandt’s pose and dress are inspired by several other works, including Raphael’s portrait of Baldassare Castiglione (now in The Louvre), the author of “The Book of the Courtier,’ a manual on good manners for renaissance gentlemen, Williams said. Rembrandt saw the painting at an art auction and was so impressed that he made a drawing of it and noted the high price – 35 guilders – for which it sold. He understood the value of the piece, both on the market and historically, and as an ambitious artist he probably aspired for his work to do as well. The didactic on the wall near Rembrandt’s self-portrait offers more examples of his inspiration, including work by Albrecht Durer.
