						<p><strong>The British Museum, in the Bloomsbury area of London, England, is a public institution dedicated to human history, art and culture. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely collected during the era of the British Empire. It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.
							 It was the first public national museum in the world. The Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane.Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881.

               <p><strong>
                The Palmer Cup is about 800 years old and of exceptional quality. It has survived thanks to being prized from the moment it was made. Itâ€™s made up of an enamelled glass beaker from Syria or Egypt in the early 1200s mounted on a silver-gilt foot made in France shortly afterwards. In 1893, Mrs Palmer-Morewood took it to the British Museum for identification. Curator A W Franks suggested she put it up for auction, where it was purchased by Baron Ferdinand. Franks had probably tipped off the Baron in the hope that it would end up at the Museum. </Strong></p>

This is one of a pair of guardian figures that flanked one of the entrances into the throne room of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). Stone mythological guardians, sculpted in the relief or in the round, were often placed at gateways to ancient Mesopotamia palaces, to protect them from demonic forces.
