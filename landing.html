												<h3>Day 1</h3>

											<p>We spent 2 days on the train from Shanghai to Lhasa. During this time, we played cards with others to kill time. Unfortunately, I lost a sock on the train.</p>

											<p> Although we walked a lot,it was worth seeing such scenery. A group of tibetans lived here, but they were too shy to take a selfie with us.</p>

											<h3>Day 4</h3>
										</header>
										<p> We climbed a moutain 5000 meters above sea level. It was starting to snow at that time, and oxygen became a kind of luxuries for us. On top of the moutain, we saw this small lake. It was a little disappointing, but the guide told us it is the holy lake in Tibetan Buddhism. I guess it was worthy.</p>

											<h3>Day 5 </h3>
										</header>
											<p>We went to visit another holy lake. There are a lot of holy lakes in Tibet and local people never fish in these lakes. Fortunately, we didn't need to climb another mountain for this. During the walking, my mom asked me to take a picture for her.</p>
