							<h2>The Imperial Palace</h2>
							<p>The chief attraction of Tokyo's Marunouchi district is the Imperial Palace (Kōkyo) with its beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats. Still in use by the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace stands on the site where, in 1457, the Feudal Lord Ota Dokan built the first fortress, the focal point from which the city of Tokyo (or Edo, as it was then) gradually spread.</p>

							<h2>Tokyo Skytree</h2>
							<p>This 634-meter-tall communications and observation tower rises out of the city's Sumida district of Minato like a huge rocket ship.

The country's tallest structure (and the world's tallest freestanding tower), the Tokyo Skytree opened in 2012 and has quickly become one of the city's most visited tourist attractions thanks to the incredible panoramic views from its restaurant and observation decks.
